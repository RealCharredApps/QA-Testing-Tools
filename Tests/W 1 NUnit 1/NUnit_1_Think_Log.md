# Quick QA Log - NUnit Advanced Learning
**Date:** June 18, 2025  
**Duration:** [X] hours  
**Focus:** Dive deep into Advanced Test Organization in NUnit

---

## Setup
1. Create Test .net project
2. install NUnit properly
3. Check .csproj file for NUnit usage 

## Plan for Challenge 1
1. Analyze the project
2. Use the data endpoints to design a test user injection
3. Clean up data... 

## Discoveries 
1. Creating new user has to be an array 'testUser' with endpoints
2. Must init vars at top
3. Must do ontime and normal setup, action/test, then cleanup both
4. **Make sure the actual code is all using the right class/namespace**
5. Run bashdotnet test --logger:console;verbosity=detailed to test... 
6. Get help as needed // practice practice practice
7. Test finds breaks in the program... that's good
8. An adjustment to the code (used ai as SE to fix)

## The Learning Point
This is exactly the kind of bug you'd find in real applications:

API contract mismatch - GetUser doesn't return what CreateUser stored
Default value conflicts - Properties defaulting to empty override intended values
State management - Service doesn't properly maintain user data

## What This Teaches You
Before (broken):

CreateUser: "I'll pretend to save this"
GetUser: "I'll return empty data regardless"
No actual data persistence

After (working):

CreateUser: "I'll actually store this data"
GetUser: "I'll return the data I actually stored"
Real data flow that can be tested

The Real-World Connection
This is exactly what you'd test in encrypted data system:

Create entry → Store encrypted data
Retrieve entry → Decrypt and return the same data
Verify integrity → Ensure what you get back matches what you put in

If the retrieval returned empty data instead of your journal entry, that's a critical data loss bug.
